## API

### `<Scope>`
Scope must be installed at the root of your app. Offers only exist within a scope.

### `<Offer name="name" value={value} />`
Offer makes a value available within the scope.

### `<Need value="name">{val => ...}</Need>`
Resolves the value name by looking in the Scope for offers. If no offer is found, it will not render its chidlren.

### `<Need values={['name1', 'name2']}">{(name1, name2)=> ...}</Need>`
Resolves all values by looking in the Scope for offers. If value cannot be resolved, it will not render its chidlren.

### `<Want value="name">{val => ...}</Want>`
Resolves the value name by looking in the Scope for offers. If no offer is found, it will not render its chidlren.

### `<Want values={['name1', 'name2']}">{(name1, name2)=> ...}</Want>`
Resolves all values by looking in the Scope for offers. Renders its chidlren even if some of its wanted values could not be found.

*That's it. Cheers*
